# react-highlighter-ts
This is a TypeScript rewrite of the popular npm package
[`react-highligher`](https://github.com/helior/react-highlighter), which has no
type support, has very out of date dependencies, and seems to be abandoned (no
activity since 2018).

See [generated type
documentation](https://chadlavi.github.io/react-highlighter-ts/) for details

## development setup
This library does not use any global dependencies, so a simple `npm install`
should suffice.

## testing

Tests use Jest + Enzyme. 

```sh
npm run test
```

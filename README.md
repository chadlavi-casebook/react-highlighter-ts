# react-highlighter-ts
This is a TypeScript rewrite of the popular npm package
[`react-highligher`](https://github.com/helior/react-highlighter), which has no
type support, has very out of date dependencies, and seems to be abandoned (no
activity since 2018).

See [generated type
documentation](https://chadlavi.github.io/react-highlighter-ts/) for details
